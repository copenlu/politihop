# PolitiHop

This repo contains the **PolitiHop** dataset introduced in the paper ["Multi-Hop Fact Checking of Political Claims"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.06401.pdf) and the accompanying experiments.

In this project, we study how to perform more complex claim verification on naturally occurring claims with multiple hops over evidence chunks. We first construct a small annotated dataset, **PolitiHop**, of reasoning chains for claim verification. We then compare the dataset to other existing multi-hop datasets and study how to transfer knowledge from more extensive in- and out-of-domain resources to PolitiHop. We find that the task is complex, and achieve the best performance using an architecture that specifically models reasoning over evidence chains in combination with in-domain transfer learning.

## IN PROGRESS: The code for the experiments is currently being prepared!
