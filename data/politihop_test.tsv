the carrier they offered, according to a KFF survey ."", ""Of that group, almost a fifth \u2014 18% \u2015 ultimately did change insurance carriers."", ""That flux would likely increase under a plan like Buttigieg\u2019s."", ""Already, many employers (particularly smaller ones) indicate frustration with providing a health benefit that is increasingly complex and expensive."", ""If a public option were cheaper, more might shift employees into that pool, dropping private insurance."", ""\""Even if you don\u2019t want the public option, your employer might decide that they do,\"" Cox said."", ""How big the change would be is difficult to gauge."", ""It depends, for instance, on how generous the public option is, how much it costs employers and whether current private insurance trends continue."", ""Still, \""any change you make to the health care environment would cause changes to reverberate throughout the system,\"" said Sherry Glied, a health economist and dean of New York
