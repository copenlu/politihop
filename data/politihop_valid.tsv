state and county governments were the primary vehicles for offering aid to Confederate veterans and their families, according to Susanah Ural, a professor of history at the University of Southern Mississippi, where she also serves as co-director of the Dale Center for the Study of War and Society."", ""\""It became a huge issue, because a lot of families had been promised that if the man left or was injured, we\u2019ll make sure the family is taken care of,\"" Ural said, noting that states had to allocate significant funds to the effort, considering the high number of fatalities and the families left behind."", ""Union soldiers and widows received a pension from the federal government and were able to obtain care from federally-run hospitals and homes."", ""Confederate veterans could not."", ""\""The federal government was never paying Confederate pensions at that point,\"" Ural said."", ""\""You took up arms against the federal government, so they\u2019re not going to do that.\"""", ""There were also differences when it came to burial."", ""National cemeteries were originally created to honor Union soldiers, according to the National Park Service."", ""Confederate veterans could not be buried in these cemeteries, with some exceptions."", ""Soldiers captured as prisoners of war were buried in designated sections within the cemeteries."", ""In 1929: Headstones approved for Confederate graves In 1906, the federal government authorized the placement of headstones for Confederate soldiers who were buried in national cemeteries \u2014 a small percentage of all those who died."", ""It was not until 1929 that Congress authorized Confederate soldiers buried in unmarked graves anywhere to receive \u2014 when requested \u2014 \""appropriate Government headstones or markers at the expense of the United States.\"""", ""In 1958: Federal pensions for veterans, widows By the time Congress authorized federal pensions for Confederate veterans and their widows, the Spanish-American War, World War I and World War II had come to pass."", ""It was 1958 (Miller got the year wrong) and the country was in the throws of the Cold War, prompting a wave of reconciliation internally."", ""\""They made a very big deal about the last surviving veterans on both sides,\"" said Barbara Gannon, an associate history professor at the University of Central Florida who specializes in the Civil War and military history."", ""\""It was about saying: \u2018We\u2019re all real Americans, as opposed to Communists\u2019.\"""", ""Also at this point, the last surviving verified Confederate veteran had died."", ""Pleasant Crump died in 1951 at the age of 104, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs."", ""Another man purporting to be a Confederate veteran was still alive, but his status is disputed."", ""He died in 1959."", ""News reports from 1958 said there were an estimated 1,500 widows of Confederate soldiers who were still alive and could potentially qualify for the pension."", ""The last surviving Confederate widow was Maudie Hopkins, who died in 2008 at the age of 93, according to the VA."", ""But Hopkins did not receive pension benefits after her husband\u2019s death, according to her obituary in the Seattle Times."", ""The law stated that the Veterans Administration \""shall pay to each person who served in the military or naval forces of the Confederate States of America during the Civil War a monthly pension in the same amounts and subject to the same conditions as would have been applicable to such person ... if his service in such forces had been service in the military or naval service of the United States.\"""", ""But there were no surviving veterans to take advantage of this benefit."", ""\""It is reasonable to assert that no portion of federal aid ever went to the care of a single Confederate veteran,\"" reads an article published on the website for \""The Journal of the Civil War Era\"" exploring care offered to veterans after the war."", ""Even though there were no surviving veterans who claimed the pension offered by the 1958 legislation, Gannon said the effort was more about the push for reconciliation."", ""\""These were gestures, but they were important gestures to southerners,\"" she said."", ""In a March 1958 column by George Dixon , published in The Evening Independent, then-Sen.
