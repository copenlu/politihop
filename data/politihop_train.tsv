unemployed could potentially fill a 4,000 of those."", ""That leaves 4,500 bachelor\u2019s-level jobs unfilled."", ""And that\u2019s quite a bit smaller than Gee\u2019s 20,000 figure."", ""Some caveats We should emphasize that our estimates involve a lot of moving parts, each with a source of statistical error."", ""We also focused on bachelor\u2019s-level jobs."", ""If we were to instead

21,400 jobs requiring advanced skills, rather than 9,500."", ""Using this broader number could make Gee\u2019s figures closer to accurate."", ""Finally, we should note that in the Georgetown comparison, West Virginia ranks 51st in the nation -- dead last among the 50 states and the District of Columbia -- in the percentage of jobs requiring advanced skills."", ""So West Virginia may require advanced skills to fill many of its jobs, but the pressure to fill these advanced-skill jobs is weaker in West Virginia than it is in every other state."", ""\""Gee's argument could have been

potential jurors in California."", ""First, people who are summoned for jury duty don\u2019t \""turn it down,\"" said Blaine Corren, a public affairs analyst for the Judicial Council of California ."", ""Rather, they can be excused from jury duty for various reasons, or a court can disqualify them from serving based on a number of factors including not being 18 or older, having a felony conviction on their record or for not being a citizen of the United States."", ""The council collects statewide data on how many people were excused or disqualified and why \u2014 with some caveats."", ""That information comes to the council from individual trial courts but since there\u2019s no requirement that courts provide this data, some courts and categories may be missing in the Jury Data Reports the council produces."", ""The data the state keeps on why someone was excused from jury duty includes financial hardship and physical or mental disabilities, but not citizenship status."", ""The Judicial Council of California does, however, keep track of how many people were disqualified for jury duty because they\u2019re not citizens."", ""We requested the council\u2019s reports through the most recent fiscal year for which a completed report is available, which was July 2017-June 2018."", ""Our analysis shows that, annually, around 1 million people \u2014 citizens and noncitizens \u2014\u00a0are disqualified from jury duty in California."", ""Approximately half aren\u2019t citizens."", ""From July 2008 through June 2017, about 11.3 million people were disqualified."", ""Of those, about 4.7 million were disqualified for not being a U.S. citizen."", ""In 2017-2018, 1,063,784 people overall were disqualified with 425,814 for not being citizens."", ""But it was fiscal year 2016-17 that has a figure that comes closest to the claim in the Facebook post: Among 1,096,478 people who were disqualified for jury duty that year, 449,404 were disqualified for not being U.S. citizens."", ""But that doesn\u2019t mean that those rejected juror candidates were registered to vote."", ""One of the primary sources courts use to summon jurors is the voter registration list, Corren said."", ""The other is the state Department of Motor Vehicles\u2019 list of licensed drivers and identification card holders in the area served by the court."", ""Noncitizens, such as lawful permanent residents, can get driver\u2019s licenses."", ""As of 2015 , undocumented immigrants in California can, too."", ""So it follows that noncitizens \u2014 both lawful permanent residents and undocumented immigrants \u2014\u00a0would be summoned for jury duty as courts tap potential jurors from DMV data."", ""\""These two lists are considered inclusive of a representative cross-section of the population, according to the California Code of Civil Procedure,\"" Corren said."", ""But, he added, courts could seek jurors from other sources like telephone directories and utility company lists."", ""In Nevada County, Calif., for example, 97 potential jurors were excused because they weren\u2019t citizens, said Jason Galkin, court executive officer of

Speaker: Bloggers	"[""As catastrophic bushfires spread across parts of Australia, misinformation about one of the region\u2019s most beloved animals, the koala, spreads, too."", ""Areas of Australia started to burn in September 2019, marking an early start to the region\u2019s fire season and scorching more than 5 million acres in News South Wales and parts of Queensland."", ""When the fires became international news, online stories \u2013 like this one \u2013 went viral with shocking headlines that claim koalas are now \""functionally extinct\"" as a result of the blaze."", ""It is true that several hundred koalas have died in the bushfires ( some estimates put the death toll in the thousands) and large swaths of the marsupial\u2019s habitat have been destroyed."", ""However, the claim that koalas are \""functionally extinct\"" is inaccurate."", ""The story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed."", ""(Read more about our partnership with Facebook .)"", ""It appears that the idea that koalas are \""functionally extinct\"" started when the Australian Koala Foundation , a local conservation nonprofit that advocates for koala protection and preservation, released a statement in May 2019 calling on Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison to enact the Koala Protection Act, which was written in 2016."", ""\""The Australian Koala Foundation (AKF) believes Koalas may be functionally extinct in the entire landscape of Australia,\"" the statement says."", ""\""The AKF thinks there are no more than 80,000 Koalas in Australia.\"""", ""Since the fires, the organization released another statement in October 2019 standing by its use of the term."", ""Noah Greenwald, endangered species director at the US-based Center for Biological Diversity , told PolitiFact there are two different definitions of \""functionally extinct.\"""", ""One is that a species still occurs in the wild but can\u2019t effectively reproduce, so is all but extinct."", ""The other, is that a species is so reduced that it can no longer play its role in the ecosystem."", ""Neither definition, he says, applies to the koala."", ""The koala population is indeed declining, but AKF\u2019s estimate is much lower than other assessments."", ""The International Union for Conservation (IUCN), the global authority on the conservation status of all species, approximates that 300,000 mature adult koalas remain in the wild, and lists the species as vulnerable , a step above endangered and two above critically endangered."", ""But IUCN last assessed the koala population in 2014, and the species may very well be worse off due to food degradation, deforestation, hunting, drought and fires over the last several years."", ""That said, another group of scholars studied the koala population in 2016 and found comparable numbers."", ""Nevertheless, several wildlife experts reject the notion that koalas are currently \""functionally extinct.\"""", ""\""By either definition, it's hard to see koalas as functionally extinct,\"" Greenwald said."", ""\""The last estimate for their numbers is roughly 300,000, and in some places they are very much playing their ecological role of munching on eucalyptus leaves.\"""", ""Wildlife conservation experts also told National Geographic that it\u2019s difficult to measure koala populations, even at the best of times, because the animal has a wide range across eastern Australia, are human-shy and live very high up in trees."", ""Christine Adams-Hosking, a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Queensland in Australia, told PolitiFact that koalas \""are certainly not functionally extinct\"" in Australia."", ""And though they have been affected by habitat loss as a result of the fires, she said, it\u2019s too early to know the impact."", ""\""We will never know exact numbers because we don\u2019t know how many koalas exactly there were there in the first place,\"" she said."", ""\""Time will tell."", ""Over the next few years, the burnt areas will need to be monitored to see how many koalas recolonize the burnt areas and whether they can successfully build up their population numbers again.\"""", ""PolitiFact also reached out to the World Wide Fund for Nature-Australia about the claim."", ""The organization\u2019s senior manager for land clearing and restoration, Stuart Blanch, told us that while the bushfires are a setback for koala conservation, WWF-Australia does not agree that the species is functionally extinct."", ""The organization estimates that from July to November, the fires scorched more than 8% of the known koala forest in New South Wales and that, even before the
